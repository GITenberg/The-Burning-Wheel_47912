<a id="THE_BURNING_WHEEL"></a>THE BURNING WHEEL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wearied of its own turning,<br />
Distressed with its own busy restlessness,<br />
Yearning to draw the circumferent pain&mdash;<br />
The rim that is dizzy with speed&mdash;<br />
To the motionless centre, there to rest,<br />
The wheel must strain through agony<br />
On agony contracting, returning<br />
Into the core of steel.<br />
And at last the wheel has rest, is still,<br />
Shrunk to an adamant core:<br />
Fulfilling its will in fixity.<br />
But the yearning atoms, as they grind<br />
Closer and closer, more and more<br />
Fiercely together, beget<br />
A flaming fire upward leaping,<br />
Billowing out in a burning,<br />
Passionate, fierce desire to find<br />
The infinite calm of the mother's breast.<br />
And there the flame is a Christ-child sleeping,<br />
Bright, tenderly radiant;<br />
All bitterness lost in the infinite<br />
Peace of the mother's bosom.<br />
But death comes creeping in a tide<br />
Of slow oblivion, till the flame in fear<br />
Wakes from the sleep of its quiet brightness<br />
And burns with a darkening passion and pain,<br />
Lest, all forgetting in quiet, it perish.<br />
And as it burns and anguishes it quickens,<br />
Begetting once again the wheel that yearns&mdash;<br />
Sick with its speed&mdash;for the terrible stillness<br />
Of the adamant core and the steel-hard chain.<br />
And so once more<br />
Shall the wheel revolve till its anguish cease<br />
In the iron anguish of fixity;<br />
Till once again<br />
Flame billows out to infinity,<br />
Sinking to a sleep of brightness<br />
In that vast oblivious peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="DOORS_OF_THE_TEMPLE"></a>DOORS OF THE TEMPLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many are the doors of the spirit that lead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the inmost shrine:</span><br />
And I count the gates of the temple divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since the god of the place is God indeed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And these are the gates that God decreed</span><br />
Should lead to his house:&mdash;kisses and wine,<br />
Cool depths of thought, youth without rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And calm old age, prayer and desire,</span><br />
The lover's and mother's breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fire of sense and the poet's fire.</span><br />
<br />
But he that worships the gates alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forgetting the shrine beyond, shall see</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The great valves open suddenly,</span><br />
Revealing, not God's radiant throne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the fires of wrath and agony.</span><br />
<br />

<a id="VILLIERS_DE_LISLE-ADAM"></a>VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Up from the darkness on the laughing stage<br />
A sudden trap-door shot you unawares,<br />
Incarnate Tragedy, with your strange airs<br />
Of courteous sadness. Nothing could assuage<br />
The secular grief that was your heritage,<br />
Passed down the long line to the last that bears<br />
The name, a gift of yearnings and despairs<br />
Too greatly noble for this iron age.<br />
<br />
Time moved for you not in quotidian beats,<br />
But in the long slow rhythm the ages keep<br />
In their immortal symphony. You taught<br />
That not in the harsh turmoil of the streets<br />
Does life consist; you bade the soul drink deep<br />
Of infinite things, saying: "The rest is naught."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="DARKNESS"></a>DARKNESS.<br />
<br />
<br />
My close-walled soul has never known<br />
That innermost darkness, dazzling sight,<br />
Like the blind point, whence the visions spring<br />
In the core of the gazer's chrysolite ...<br />
The mystic darkness that laps God's throne<br />
In a splendour beyond imagining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So passing bright.</span><br />
<br />
But the many twisted darknesses<br />
That range the city to and fro,<br />
In aimless subtlety pass and part<br />
And ebb and glutinously flow;<br />
Darkness of lust and avarice,<br />
Of the crippled body and the crooked heart ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These darknesses I know.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="MOLE"></a>MOLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tunnelled in solid blackness creeps<br />
The old mole-soul, and wakes or sleeps,<br />
He knows not which, but tunnels on<br />
Through ages of oblivion;<br />
Until at last the long constraint<br />
Of each-hand wall is lost, and faint<br />
Comes daylight creeping from afar,<br />
And mole-work grows crepuscular.<br />
Tunnel meets air and bursts; mole sees<br />
Men hugely walking ... or are they trees?<br />
And far horizons smoking blue,<br />
And chasing clouds for ever new?<br />
Green hills, like lighted lamps aglow<br />
Or quenching 'neath the cloud-shadow;<br />
Quenching and blazing turn by turn,<br />
Spring's great green signals fitfully burn.<br />
Mole travels on, but finds the steering<br />
A harder task of pioneering<br />
Than when he thridded through the strait<br />
Blind catacombs that ancient fate<br />
Had carved for him. Stupid and dumb<br />
And blind and touchless he had come<br />
A way without a turn; but here,<br />
Under the sky, the passenger<br />
Chooses his own best way; and mole<br />
Distracted wanders, yet his hole<br />
Regrets not much wherein he crept,<br />
But runs, a joyous nympholept,<br />
This way and that, by all made mad&mdash;<br />
River nymph and oread,<br />
Ocean's daughters and Lorelei,<br />
Combing the silken mystery,<br />
The glaucous gold of her rivery tresses&mdash;<br />
Each haunts the traveller, each possesses<br />
The drunken wavering soul awhile;<br />
Then with a phantom's cock-crow smile<br />
Mocks craving with sheer vanishment.<br />
<br />
Mole-eyes grow hawk's: knowledge is lent<br />
In grudging driblets that pay high<br />
Unconscionable usury<br />
To unrelenting life. Mole learns<br />
To travel more secure; the turns<br />
Of his long way less puzzling seem,<br />
And all those magic forms that gleam<br />
In airy invitation cheat<br />
Less often than they did of old.<br />
<br />
The earth slopes upward, fold by fold<br />
Of quiet hills that meet the gold<br />
Serenity of western skies.<br />
Over the world's edge with clear eyes<br />
Our mole transcendent sees his way<br />
Tunnelled in light: he must obey<br />
Necessity again and thrid<br />
Close catacombs as erst he did,<br />
Fate's tunnellings, himself must bore<br />
Through the sunset's inmost core.<br />
The guiding walls to each-hand shine<br />
Luminous and crystalline;<br />
And mole shall tunnel on and on,<br />
Till night let fall oblivion.<br />
<br />

<br />
<a id="THE_TWO_SEASONS"></a>THE TWO SEASONS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summer, on himself intent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed without, for nothing caring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save his own high festival.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My windows, blind and winkless staring,</span><br />
Wondered what the pageant meant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor ever understood at all.</span><br />
And oh, the pains of sentiment!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loneliness beyond all bearing ...</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mucus and spleen and gall!</span><br />
<br />
But now that grey November peers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In at my fire-bright window pane?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all its misty spires and trees</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loom in upon me through the rain</span><br />
And question of the light that cheers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The room within&mdash;now my soul sees</span><br />
Life, where of old were sepulchres;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And in these new-found sympathies</span><br />
Sinks petty hopes and loves and fears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knows that life is not in vain.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="TWO_REALITIES"></a>TWO REALITIES.<br />
<br />
<br />
A waggon passed with scarlet wheels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a yellow body, shining new.</span><br />
"Splendid!" said I. "How fine it feels<br />
To be alive, when beauty peels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grimy husk from life." And you</span><br />
<br />
Said, "Splendid!" and I thought you'd seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That waggon blazing down the street;</span><br />
But I looked and saw that your gaze had been<br />
On a child that was kicking an obscene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brown ordure with his feet.</span><br />
<br />
Our souls are elephants, thought I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remote behind a prisoning grill,</span><br />
With trunks thrust out to peer and pry<br />
And pounce upon reality;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And each at his own sweet will</span><br />
<br />
Seizes the bun that he likes best<br />
And passes over all the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="QUOTIDIAN_VISION"></a>QUOTIDIAN VISION.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a sadness in the street,<br />
And sullenly the folk I meet<br />
Droop their heads as they walk along,<br />
Without a smile, without a song.<br />
A mist of cold and muffling grey<br />
Falls, fold by fold, on another day<br />
That dies unwept. But suddenly,<br />
Under a tunnelled arch I see<br />
On flank and haunch the chestnut gleam<br />
Of horses in a lamplit steam;<br />
And the dead world moves for me once more<br />
With beauty for its living core.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VISION"></a>VISION.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had been sitting alone with books,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till doubt was a black disease,</span><br />
When I heard the cheerful shout of rooks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the bare, prophetic trees.</span><br />
<br />
Bare trees, prophetic of new birth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You lift your branches clean and free</span><br />
To be a beacon to the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A flame of wrath for all to see.</span><br />
<br />
And the rooks in the branches laugh and shout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To those that can hear and understand;</span><br />
"Walk through the gloomy ways of doubt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the torch of vision in your hand."</span><br />

<a id="THE_MIRROR"></a>THE MIRROR.<br />

<br />
Slow-moving moonlight once did pass<br />
Across the dreaming looking-glass,<br />
Where, sunk inviolably deep,<br />
Old secrets unforgotten sleep<br />
Of beauties unforgettable.<br />
<br />
But dusty cobwebs are woven now<br />
Across that mirror, which of old<br />
Saw fingers drawing back the gold<br />
From an untroubled brow;<br />
And the depths are blinded to the moon,<br />
And their secrets forgotten, for ever untold.<br />

Youth as it opens out discloses<br />
The sinister metempsychosis<br />
Of lilies dead and turned to roses<br />
Red as an angry dawn.<br />
But lilies, remember, are grave-side flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While slow bright rose-leaves sail</span><br />
Adrift on the music of happiest hours;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those lilies, cold and pale,</span><br />
Hide fiery roses beneath the lawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the young bride's parting veil.</span><br />

I.<br />
<br />
'TWas I that leaned to Amoret<br />
With: "What if the briars have tangled Time,<br />
Till, lost in the wood-ways, he quite forget<br />
How plaintive in cities at midnight sounds the chime<br />
Of bells slow-dying from discord to the hush whence<br />
they rose and met.<br />
<br />
"And in the forest we shall live free,<br />
Free from the bondage that Time has made<br />
To hedge our soul from its liberty?<br />
We shall not fear what is mighty, and unafraid<br />
Shall look wide-eyed at beauty, nor shrink from its majesty."<br />
<br />
But Amoret answered me again:<br />
"We are lost in the forest, you and I;<br />
Lost, lost, not free, though no bonds restrain;<br />
For no spire rises for comfort, no landmark in the sky,<br />
And the long glades as they curve from sight are dark<br />
with a nameless pain.<br />
<br />
And Time creates what he devours,&mdash;<br />
Music that sweetly dreams itself away,<br />
Frail-swung leaves of autumn and the scent of flowers,<br />
And the beauty of that poised moment, when the day<br />
Hangs 'twixt the quiet of darkness and the mirth of the<br />
sunlit hours."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II.<br />
<br />
Mottled and grey and brown they pass,<br />
The wood-moths, wheeling, fluttering;<br />
And we chase and they vanish; and in the grass<br />
Are starry flowers, and the birds sing<br />
Faint broken songs of the dying spring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on the beech-bole, smooth and grey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some lover of an older day</span><br />
Has carved in time-blurred lettering<br />
One word only&mdash;"Alas."<br />

Lutes, I forbid you! You must never play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When shimmeringly, glimpse by glimpse</span><br />
Seen through the leaves, the silken figures sway<br />
In measured dance. Never at shut of day,<br />
When Time perversely loitering limps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through endless twilights, should your strings</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whisper of light remembered things</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That happened long ago and far away:</span><br />
Lutes, I forbid you! You must never play...<br />
<br />
And you, pale marble statues, far descried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where vistas open suddenly,</span><br />
I bid you shew yourselves no more, but hide<br />
Your loveliness, lest too much glorified<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By western radiance slantingly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot down the glade, you turn from stone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To living gods, immortal grown,</span><br />
And, ageless, mock my beauty's fleeting pride,<br />
You pale, relentless statues, far descried...<br />

Old ghosts that death forgot to ferry<br />
Across the Lethe of the years-<br />
These are my friends, and at their tears<br />
I weep and with their mirth am merry.<br />
On a high tower, whose battlements<br />
Give me all heaven at a glance,<br />
I lie long summer nights in trance,<br />
Drowsed by the murmurs and the scents<br />
That rise from earth, while the sky above me<br />
Merges its peace with my soul's peace,<br />
Deep meeting deep. No stir can move me,<br />
Nought break the quiet of my release:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In vain the windy sunlight raves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the hush and gloom of polar caves.</span><br />

One head of my soul's amphisbaena<br />
Turns to the daytime's dust and sweat;<br />
But evenings come, when I would forget<br />
The sordid strife of the arena.<br />
<br />
And then my other self will creep<br />
Along the scented twilight lanes<br />
To where a little house contains<br />
A hoard of books, a gift of sleep.<br />
<br />
Its windows throw a friendly light<br />
Between the narrowing shutter slats,<br />
And, golden as the eyes of cats,<br />
Shine me a welcome through the night.<br />

I seek the quietude of stones<br />
Or of great oxen, dewlap-deep<br />
In meadows of lush grass, where sleep<br />
Drifts, tufted, on the air or drones<br />
On flowery traffic. Sleep atones<br />
For sin, comforting eyes that weep.<br />
O'er me, Lethean darkness, creep<br />
Unfelt as tides through dead men's bones!<br />
<br />
In that metallic sea of hair,<br />
Fragrance! I come to drown despair<br />
Of wings in dark forgetfulness.<br />
No love ... Love is self-known, aspires<br />
To heights unearthly. I ask less,&mdash;<br />
Sleep born of satisfied desires.<br />

There shall be dark trees round me:&mdash;I insist<br />
On cypresses: I'm terribly romantic&mdash;<br />
And glimpsed between shall move the whole Atlantic,<br />
Now leaden dull, now subtle with grey mist,<br />
Now many jewelled, when the waves are kissed<br />
By revelling sunlight and the corybantic<br />
South-Western wind: so, troubled, passion-frantic,<br />
The poet's mind boils gold and amethyst.<br />
<br />
There shall be seen the infinite endeavour<br />
Of a sad fountain, white against the sky<br />
And poised as it strains up, but doomed to break<br />
In weeping music; ever fair and ever<br />
Young ... and the bright-eyed wood-gods as they slake<br />
Their thirst in it, are silent, reverently ...<br />

<a id="THE_CANAL"></a>THE CANAL.<br />
<br />
<br />
No dip and dart of swallows wakes the black<br />
Slumber of the canal:&mdash;a mirror dead<br />
For lack of loveliness remembered<br />
From ancient azures and green trees, for lack<br />
Of some white beauty given and flung back,<br />
Secret, to her that gave: no sun has bled<br />
To wake an echo here of answering red;<br />
The surface stirs to no leaf's wind-blown track.<br />
<br />
Between unseeing walls the waters rest,<br />
Lifeless and hushed, till suddenly a swan<br />
Glides from some broader river blue as day,<br />
And with the mirrored magic of his breast<br />
Creates within that barren water-way<br />
New life, new loveliness, and passes on.<br />

I'm sick of clownery and Owlglass tricks;<br />
Damn the whole crowd of you I I hate you all.<br />
The same, night after night, from powdered stall<br />
To sweating gallery, your faces fix<br />
In flux an idiot mean. The Apteryx<br />
You worship is no victory; you call<br />
On old stupidity, God made to crawl<br />
For tempting with world-wisdom's narcotics.<br />
<br />
I'll break a window through my prison! See,<br />
The sunset bleeds among the roofs; comes night,<br />
Dark blue and calm as music dying out.<br />
Is it escape? No, the laugh's turned on me!<br />
I kicked at cardboard, gaped at red limelight;<br />
You laughed and cheered my latest knockabout.<br />

<a id="MISPLACED_LOVE"></a>MISPLACED LOVE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Red wine that slowly leaned and brimmed the shell<br />
Of pearl, where lips had touched, as light and swift<br />
As naked petals of the rose adrift<br />
Upon the lazy-luted ritournelle<br />
Of summer bee-song: laughing as they fell,<br />
Gold memories: dream incense, childhood's gift,<br />
Blue as the smoke that far horizons lift,<br />
Tenuous as the wings of Ariel:&mdash;<br />
<br />
These treasured things I laid upon the pyre;<br />
And the flame kindled, and I fanned it high,<br />
And, strong in hope, could watch the crumbling past.<br />
Eager I knelt before the waning fire,<br />
Phoenix, to greet thine immortality ...<br />
But there was naught but ashes at the last.<br />

<a id="SONNET"></a>SONNET.<br />
<br />
<br />
Were I to die, you'd break your heart, you say.<br />
Well, if it do but bend, I'm satisfied&mdash;<br />
Bend and rebound&mdash;for hearts are temper-tried,<br />
Mild steel, not hardened, with the spring and play<br />
Of excellent tough swords. It's not that way<br />
That you'll be perishing. But when I've died,<br />
When snap! my light goes out, what will betide<br />
You, if the heart-breaks give you leave to stay?<br />
<br />
What will be left, I wonder, if you lose<br />
All that you gave me? "All? A year or so<br />
Out of a life," you say. But worlds, say I,<br />
Of kisses timeless given in ecstasy<br />
That gave me Real You. I die: you go<br />
With me. What's left? Limbs, clothes, a pair of shoes?...<br />

<a id="SENTIMENTAL_SUMMER"></a>SENTIMENTAL SUMMER.<br />
<br />
<br />
The West has plucked its flowers and has thrown<br />
Them fading on the night. Out of the sky's<br />
Black depths there smiles a greeting from those eyes,<br />
Where all the Real, all I have ever known<br />
Of the divine is held. And not alone<br />
Do I stand here now ... a presence seems to rise:<br />
Your voice sounds near across my memories,<br />
And answering fingers brush against my own.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is you: for evening holds those strands<br />
Of fire and darkness twined in one to make<br />
Your loveliness a web of magic mesh,<br />
Whose cross-weft harmony of soul and flesh<br />
Shadows a thought or glows, when smiles awake,<br />
Like sunlight passionate on southern lands.<br />

<br />
Comrade, now that you're merry<br />
And therefore true,<br />
Say&mdash;where would you like to die<br />
And have your friend to bury<br />
What once was you?<br />
"On the top of a hill<br />
With a peaceful view<br />
Of country where all is still?"...<br />
Great God, not I!<br />
I'd lie in the street<br />
Where two streams meet<br />
And there's noise enough to fill<br />
The outer ear,<br />
While within the brain can beat<br />
Marches of death and life,<br />
Glory and joy and fear,<br />
Peace of the sort that moves<br />
And clash of strife<br />
And routs of armies fleeing.<br />
There would I shake myself clear<br />
Out of the deep-set grooves<br />
Of my sluggish being.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="THE_HIGHER_SENSUALISM"></a>THE HIGHER SENSUALISM.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a church by a lake in Italy<br />
Stands white on a hill against the sky?<br />
And a path of immemorial cobbles<br />
Leads up and up, where the pilgrim hobbles<br />
Past a score or so of neat reposories,<br />
Where you stop and breathe and tell your rosaries<br />
To the shrined terra-cotta mannikins,<br />
That expound with the liveliest quirks and grins<br />
Known texts of Scripture. But no long stay<br />
Should the pilgrim make upon his way;<br />
But as means to the end these shrines stand here<br />
To guide to something holier,<br />
The church on the hilltop.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Your heaven's so,</span><br />
With a path leading up to it past a row<br />
Of votary Priapulids;<br />
At each you pause and tell your beads<br />
Along the quintuple strings of sense:<br />
Then on, to face Heaven's eminence,<br />
New stimulated, new inspired.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="SONNET_2"></a>SONNET.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that a sparkle of true starshine be<br />
That led my way; if some diviner thing<br />
Than common thought urged me to fashioning<br />
Close-woven links of burnished poetry;<br />
Then all the heaven that one time dwelt in me<br />
Has fled, leaving the body triumphing.<br />
Dead flesh it seems, with not a dream to bring<br />
Visions that better warm immediacy.<br />
<br />
Why have my visions left me, what could kill<br />
That feeble spark, which yet had life and heat?<br />
Fulfilment shewed a present rich and fair:<br />
I strive to mount, but catch the nearest still:<br />
Souls have been drowned between heart's beat and beat,<br />
And trapped and tangled in a woman's hair.<br />

I.<br />
<br />
Mother of all my future memories,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mistress of my new life, which but to-day</span><br />
Began, when I beheld, deep in your eyes,<br />
My own love mirrored and the warm surprise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the first kiss swept both our souls away,</span><br />
<br />
Your love has freed me; for I was oppressed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By my own devil, whose unwholesome breath</span><br />
Tarnished my youth, leaving to me at best<br />
Age lacking comfort of a soul at rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And weariness beyond the hope of death.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II.<br />
<br />
Ah, those were days of silent happiness!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never spoke, and had no need to speak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While on the windy down-land, cheek by cheek,</span><br />
The slow-driven sun beheld us. Each caress<br />
Had oratory for its own defence;<br />
And when I kissed or felt her fingers press,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I envied not Demosthenes his Greek,</span><br />
Nor Tully for his Latin eloquence.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<a id="PERILS_OF_THE_SMALL_HOURS"></a>PERILS OF THE SMALL HOURS.<br />
<br />
<br />
When life burns low as the fire in the grate<br />
And all the evening's books are read,<br />
I sit alone, save for the dead<br />
And the lovers I have grown to hate.<br />
<br />
But all at once the narrow gloom<br />
Of hatred and despair expands<br />
In tenderness: thought stretches hands<br />
To welcome to the midnight room<br />
<br />
Another presence:&mdash;a memory<br />
Of how last year in the sunlit field,<br />
Laughing, you suddenly revealed<br />
Beauty in immortality.<br />
<br />
For so it is; a gesture strips<br />
Life bare of all its make-believe.<br />
All unprepared we may receive<br />
Our casual apocalypse.<br />
<br />
Sheer beauty, then you seemed to stir<br />
Unbodied soul; soul sleeps to-night,<br />
And love comes, dimming spirit's sight,<br />
When body plays interpreter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="COMPLAINT"></a>COMPLAINT.<br />
<br />
I have tried to remember the familiar places,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pillared gloom of the beechwoods, the towns</span><br />
by the sea,&mdash;<br />
I have tried to people the past with dear known faces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But you were haunting me.</span><br />
<br />
Like a remorse, insistent, pitiless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You have filled my spirit, you were ever at hand;</span><br />
You have mocked my gods with your new loveliness:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Broken the old shrines stand.</span><br />

<br />
<a id="RETURN_TO_AN_OLD_HOME"></a>RETURN TO AN OLD HOME.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this wood&mdash;how the hazels have grown!&mdash;<br />
I left a treasure all my own<br />
Of childish kisses and laughter and pain;<br />
Left, till I might come back again<br />
To take from the familiar earth<br />
My hoarded secret and count its worth.<br />
And all the spider-work of the years,<br />
All the time-spun gossamers,<br />
Dewed with each succeeding spring;<br />
And the piled up leaves the Autumns fling<br />
To the sweet corruption of death on death....<br />
At the sudden stir of my spirit's breath<br />
All scattered. New and fair and bright<br />
As ever it was, before my sight<br />
The treasure lay, and nothing missed.<br />
So having handled all and kissed,<br />
I put them back, adding one new<br />
And precious memory of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="FRAGMENT"></a>FRAGMENT.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're German scholars poring over life,<br />
As over a Greek manuscript that's torn<br />
And stained beyond repair. Our eyes of horn<br />
Read one or two poor letters; and what strife,<br />
What books on books begotten for their sake!<br />
But we enjoy it; and meanwhile neglect<br />
The line that's left us perfect from the wrecked<br />
Rich argosy, clear beyond doubts to make<br />
Conjectures of. So in my universe<br />
Of scribbled half-hid meanings you appear,<br />
Sole perfect symbol of the highest sphere;<br />
And life's great matrix crystal, whose depths nurse<br />
Soul's infinite reflections, glows in you<br />
With now uncertain radiance...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="THE_WALK"></a>THE WALK.<br />
<br />
<br />
I. THROUGH THE SUBURBS.<br />
<br />
Provincial Sunday broods above the town:<br />
The street's asleep; through a dim window drifts<br />
A small romance that hiccoughs up and down<br />
An air all trills and runs and sudden lifts<br />
To yearning sevenths poised ... not Chopin quite,<br />
But, oh, romantic; a tinsel world made bright<br />
With rose and honeysuckle's paper blooms,<br />
And where the moon's blue limelight and the glooms<br />
Of last-act scenes of passion are discreet.<br />
And when the tinkling stops and leaves the street<br />
Blank in the sunlight of the afternoon<br />
You feel a curtain dropped. Poor little tune!<br />
Perhaps our grandmother's dull girlhood days<br />
Were fired by you with radiances of pink,<br />
Heavenly, brighter far than she could think<br />
Anything might be ... till a greater blaze<br />
Tinged life's horizon, when he kissed her first,<br />
Our grandpapa. But a thin ghost still plays<br />
In music down the street, echoing the plaint<br />
Of far romance with its own sadder song<br />
Of Everyday; and as they walk along,...<br />
The young man and the woman, deep immersed<br />
In all the suburb-comedy around ...<br />
They seem to catch coherence in the sound<br />
Of that ghost-music, and the words come faint:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh the months and the days,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh sleeps and dinners,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh the planning of ways</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And quotidian means!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh endless vistas of mutton and greens,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh weekly mimblings of prayer and praise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh Evenings with All the Winners!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Monday sends the clothes to the wash</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Saturday brings them home again:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mon Dieu, la vie est par trop moche</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Destiny is a sale caboche;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But I'll give you heaven</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In a dominant seven,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And you shall not have lived in vain.</span><br />
<br />
"In vain," the girl repeats, "in vain, in vain ..."<br />
Your suburb's whole philosophy leads there.<br />
The ox-stall for our happiness, for pain,<br />
Poignant and sweet, the dull narcotic ache<br />
Of wretchedness, and in resigned despair<br />
A grim contentment ... ashen fruits to slake<br />
A nameless, quenchless thirst. The tinkling rain<br />
Of that small sentimental music wets<br />
Your parching suburb: it may sprout ... who knows?...<br />
In something red and silken like a rose,<br />
In sheaves of almost genuine violets.<br />
<br />
Faint chords, your sadness, secular, immense,<br />
Brims to the bursting this poor Actual heart.<br />
For surging through the floodgates that the sense<br />
On sudden lightly opens sweeps the Whole<br />
Into the narrow compass of its part.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
Inedited sensation of the soul!<br />
You'd have us bless the Hire-Purchase System,<br />
Which now allows the poorest vampers<br />
To feel, as they abuse their piano's dampers,<br />
That angels have stooped down and kissed 'em<br />
With Ave-Maries from the infinite.<br />
But poor old Infinite's dead. Long live his heir,<br />
Lord Here-and-Now ... for all the rest<br />
Is windy nothingness, or at the best<br />
Home-made Chimera, bodied with despair,<br />
Headed with formless, foolish hope.<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">No, no!</span><br />
We live in verse, for all things rhyme<br />
With something out of space and time.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
But in the suburb here life needs must flow<br />
In journalistic prose ...<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But we have set</span><br />
Our faces towards the further hills, where yet<br />
The wind untainted and unbound may blow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II. FROM THE CREST.<br />
<br />
So through the squalor, till the sky unfolds<br />
To right and left its fringes, penned no more,<br />
A thin canal, 'twixt shore and ugly shore<br />
Of hovels, poured contiguous from the moulds<br />
Of Gothic horror. Town is left at last,<br />
Save for the tentacles that probe,... a squat<br />
Dun house or two, allotments, plot on plot<br />
Of cabbage, jejune, ripe or passed,<br />
Chequering with sick yellow or verdigris<br />
The necropolitan ground; and neat paved ways<br />
That edge the road ... the town's last nerves ... and cease,<br />
As if in sudden shame, where hedges raise<br />
Their dusty greenery on either hand.<br />
Their path mounts slowly up the hill;<br />
And, as they walk, to right and left expand<br />
The plain and the golden uplands and the blue<br />
Faint smoke of distances that fade from view;<br />
And at their feet, remote and still?<br />
The city spreads itself.<br />
<br />
<i>He.</i><br />
<br />
That glabrous dome that lifts itself so grand,<br />
There in the marish, is the omphalos,<br />
The navel, umbo, middle, central boss<br />
Of the unique, sole, true Cloud-Cuckoo Land.<br />
Drowsy with Sunday bells and Sunday beer<br />
Afoam in silver rumkins, there it basks,<br />
Thinking of labours past and future tasks<br />
And pondering on the end, forever near,<br />
Yet ever distant as the rainbow's spring.<br />
For still in Cuckoo-Land they're labouring,<br />
With hopes undamped and undiscouraged hearts:<br />
A little musty, but superb, they sit,<br />
Piecing a god together bit by bit<br />
Out of the chaos of his sundered parts.<br />
Unmoved, nay pitying, they view the grins<br />
And lewd grimaces of the folk that jeer ...<br />
The vulgar herd, gross monster at the best,<br />
Obscenum Mobile, the uttermost sphere,<br />
Alas, too much the mover of the rest,<br />
Though they turn sungates to its widdershins ...<br />
<br />
And in some half a million years perhaps<br />
God may at last be made ... a new, true Pan,<br />
An Isis templed in the soul of man,<br />
An Aphrodite with her thousand paps<br />
Streaming eternal wisdom.<br />
Yes, and man's vessel, all pavilioned out<br />
With silk and flags in the fair wind astream,<br />
Shall make the port at last, with a great shout<br />
Ringing from all her decks, and rocking there shall dream<br />
For ever, and dream true ... calm in those roads<br />
As lovers' souls at evening, when they swim<br />
Between the despairing sunset and the dim<br />
Blue memories of mountains lost to sight<br />
But, like half fancied, half remembered episodes<br />
Of childhood, guessed at through the veils of night.<br />
And the worn sailors at the mast who heard<br />
The first far bells and knew the sound for home,<br />
Who marked the land-weeds and the sand-stained foam<br />
And through the storm-blast saw a wildered bird<br />
Seek refuge at the mast-head ... these at last<br />
Shall earn due praise when all the hubbub's past;<br />
And Cuckoo-Landers not a few shall prove.<br />
<br />
<i>She.</i><br />
<br />
You have fast closed the temple gates;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You stand without in the noon-tides glow,</span><br />
But the innermost darkness, where God waits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You do not know, you cannot know.</span><br />

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
